  section1Title: Protecting your workers and families from pathogens and
    infectious diseases including COVID-19
  section1Body: >-
    Our production experience makes us front runners for collaborating,
    developing, implementing new procedures, and/or working closely with
    production to ensure safety requirements are clearly explained and properly
    executed on set. We understand that staying on budget, while

    staying on schedule can be a challenge, especially with the added duty of protecting the health and safety of our crews, talent, and families from pathogens and infectious diseases including COVID-19 exposure. We approach this responsibility with reverence and respect, knowing one careless move can put us all at risk.


    Our services closely follow the guidance and recommendations published by the CDC, OSHA, DGA, SAG•AFTRA, TASK FORCE, AICP, IATSE, Local 80, and more.


    We love to be of service and look forward to producing the perfect Safety Compliance Package for your next project!
